# MNIST_KERAS_DigitRecognition

This project is implemented using CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS in Keras Api.
ACCURACY OBTAINED IS APPROX=99% AS COMPARED TO THAT OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS WHERE ACC_VALUE=97%(APPROX)
THIS CHANGE IS SEEN DUE TO THE FACT THAT DEEP LEARNING MODEL USES GLOBAL PATTERN RECOGNITION WHILE AS CNN USES
LICAL PATTERN RECOGNITION.
